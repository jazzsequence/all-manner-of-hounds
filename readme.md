> Here begynnyth the names of all maner of houndis after the a.b.c. Firste to begynne with .a. for houndis names...

This project is based on the [Medieval manuscript shared by OpenCulture](https://www.openculture.com/2022/11/a-list-of-1065-medieval-dog-names-nosewise-garlik-havegoodday-more.html) that simply lists 1,065 dog names. No big woof. (yukka yukka)

The thought was, _what could be done with 1,065 medeival dog names?_ and the answer, of course, is always Dungeons & Dragons. Therefore, this project is to build/provide a TTRPG name generator that randomly chooses from these names for whatever purpose you may need it for.

## TODO
* Finish transcribing names from OCR-read raw text file into json.
* Build a react app for the name generator
* Add styling to the app
* Build a WP plugin to display the random names? (possible future implementation)
